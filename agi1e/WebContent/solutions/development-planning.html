						Development planning at Agile is detailed and fluid, comprehensive yet flexible enough to accommodate 
						change throughout the development life cycle.
					</div>
					
					<br><br>
					Planning puts on the table every known element and function envisioned to fulfill product requirements. In 
					planning the known elements while able to pivot to address new complexities as they arise allows the product 
					owner to prioritize, enabling the team to move forward while solving pitfalls, recognizing flaws and tackling 
					them head on throughout the development life cycle through an evaluative, incremental, iterative process. 
					It’s a holistic means of development by tackling pieces of the whole; counter intuitive to some, but inherent 
					all of Agile’s services.<br><br>
					
					<div id="indentedContent">
						<strong>Planning iterations.</strong><br>
						The foundation of development planning is to determine the length of iterations; shorter iterations lend 
						urgency, whereas longer iterations can lull the team into a sense of unlimited time (and money). Iterations 
						are normally two- to four-week periods. Agile believes it is critical to keep one goal in mind: consistent 
						communication among all stakeholders ranking individuals above processes and tools results in the highest-functioning 
						product in the least amount of time in the most efficient manner. Even if a release is not scheduled, 
						iterations are the lifeblood of development and the lynchpin for planning to schedule research (architecture spikes), 
						prototyping or user story creation for subsequent releases. When planning iterations, it’s critical to schedule 
						retrospective sessions which include all stakeholders. Demonstrating features ensures lessons are learned for 
						the next iteration; feedback leads to continual adjustment leading up to product release.<br><br>
						
						<strong>User story creation.</strong><br>
						User stories are concise statements of customer requirements and are written by the entire team representing the 
						work to be done to accomplish to accomplish product requirements. Project owners know what their customers want; 
						a user story pinpoints with clarity basic customer needs with each product function broken down to the lowest 
						common denominator. Epics contain numerous user stories pinpointing features at a higher level. Creation of user 
						stories can be thought of as building blocks to reach product requirements, focusing on the most basic function 
						to perform, and then creating a second user story with more complex function.<br><br>
						
						<strong>Product owner.</strong><br>
						The product owner has a full understanding of customer needs and serves to ensure team members understand customer 
						requirements. Agile planning allows team members to tackle features as ranked by the product owners. A close working 
						relationship between product owner and team members is the art of Agile practices, allowing the team to focus on 
						architecture work required to realistically predict time to release of functional components.<br><br>
						
					</div>	
				</div>
				<div id="column2" class="grid_5">
				
					<div id="indentedContent">
						
						<strong>Product backlog.</strong><br>
						In development planning, the product backlog is a prioritized list of user stories. Prioritizing the backlog allows 
						the product owner to choose pieces of customer requirements critical to implementation; a single requirement could 
						break down into a dozen user stories, but completion of a half dozen (in order of importance to the user) stories 
						may meet user requirements, allowing the team to move to the next iteration. Identifying higher-level user stories 
						and reducing them to story points allows the product owner to estimate time and cost, eliminating work that may 
						seem necessary in planning, but becomes immaterial based on desired function.<br><br>
						
						<strong>Release backlog.</strong><br>
						The product owner, using the product backlog, identifies user stories to be included in the next release, placing 
						them in the release backlog. Tracking team velocity (team accomplishments measured by time) ensures proper estimates 
						on what can and can’t be accomplished. A customer team (product manager, testers, real users, interaction designers) 
						can break down high-level user stories into smaller chunks, prioritizing them in the release backlog.<br><br>
						
						<strong>Iteration backlog.</strong><br>
						The team must select high-priority items from the release backlog and place them in the next iteration. During 
						development planning of the iteration backlog, team members examine specific tasks for each user story. When 
						conducing planning development meetings, breaking down each task required for each user story is critical, 
						estimating hours to accomplish each task and avoiding over commitment of resources. Tasks for each team member 
						must be identified. When Agile uses the Agile method of development planning, it recognizes that flexibility – 
						allowing for change throughout the process – is a key advantage. Recognizing that that a user story is more 
						complicated than originally planned and can’t realistically be contained in the iteration, team members raise the 
						issue immediately. Additional user stories may be needed in hopes of to find an interim solution and meet the 
						release deadline. The shortcoming is then noted and can be addressed in detail. If an architecture spike is needed 
						for any user story during the iteration, user stories are added to the release backlog to be prioritized by 
						the product owner.<br><br>
						
						<strong>Measuring velocity.</strong><br>
						Agile development planning hinges on tracking velocity – how much work is done by a team during iterations. 
						Basically, points are awarded for each user story completed, and no points for failing to deliver on a story. 
						By charting the points earned in iterations, the numbers can be used to determine the time to attack the remaining 
						release backlog by each team member in the next iteration.<br><br>
