					Following the Agile manifesto, the Agile Assurance Group follows the tried-and-true test as you go process, focusing 
					on the end user experience, reducing time to market, reducing cost and delivering the highest quality product possible 
					while continuously adapting to dynamically changing requirements within a flexible process.

					Development planning and test planning are tackled simultaneously with the customer always in the loop, focusing on 
					achieving incremental targets with the highest quality and customer satisfaction ever in mind.<br><br>
					
					<div id="quoteBox">
						Agile testing is context driven and involves rapid testing during the software development life cycle.
					</div>
					
					<br><br>
					Test scenarios are often unknown, and evolve during code implementation, arising from the context in which the application 
					is being used. Rapid testing is a process of defining unique strategies as opposed to a set process or method, focusing on 
					spotting defects as quickly as possible during code implementation, always focusing on end user requirements. Agile’s 
					testers’ have high-quality programming skills and rely on fleet-footed diagnostics to test the application throughout 
					development as opposed to testing at the end of code implementation.<br><br>

					In old-school development and testing, analyzing heavy documentation at the end of the software development life cycle ruled.
					Using Agile methods, testing is an integral part of iteration, producing incrementally working subsets of the whole, releasing 
					potentially shippable components at the end of each sprint. The Agile method as practiced by Agile doesn’t eschew testing; 
					it depends on testing. Agile incorporates test planning throughout the software development life cycle, pivoting as user 
					requirements change.<br><br>
					
					<span style="color:#28ade1; font-size: 20px;">
					Agile takes the customer’s business requirements and it is reviewed by our business analysts and engineering team.<br><br>
					</span>
					
					Agile’s quality assurance and testing engineers are involved at the beginning of development planning to devise a test plan.<br><br>

					During design and implementation, engineers write user stories analyzing all issues of each feature at various stages with consistent 
					customer review so the requirements can be adjusted accordingly. Agile’s test team is involved in each step so that efficient yet 
					comprehensive documentation is created – not just documentation for documentation sake – ensuring the customer, engineering and 
					test team are always on the same page.<br><br>
					
					<span style="color:#28ade1; font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold">
						At Agile, test planning is being factored into the mix before, during and after coding begins.
					</span>
					
					<br><br>
					As the engineering team begins implementation, the test team begins developing testing strategies and test-case preparation based 
					on user requirements.
				</div>
				<div id="column2" class="grid_5">
					Throughout test planning, documentation is given to the customer and engineering team for review, ensuing 
					complete test coverage and avoiding redundancies. As engineers begin writing code, Agile’s test planning team develops quick testing 
					parameters, shooting to identify defects at the earliest possible stage, sometimes recognizing defects but determining the most 
					efficient means for achieving overall development goals may mean to allow bugs to be fixed in the next round of development. Finding 
					defects doesn’t stop the development process; efficient, on-the-fly test planning incorporates fixes as code implementation continues. 
					This iterative process continues until the end of code implementation.<br><br>
					
					<div id="quoteBox">
						<span style="font-size: 18px">Testing</span> is a continual process throughout development and allows test planners to focus on 
						upcoming major test items such as integration, usability testing and system testing.
					</div>
					
					<br><br>
					It also ensures end-to-end testing results in user requirements being met in the most efficient and cost effective manner. Agile’s 
					style of test planning doesn’t mean development stops; it is seamlessly integrated into iteration, ensuring a steady stream of code 
					implementation, meeting time boxes and ever moving forward.<br><br>

					Agile’s test planning evolves during development – the testing team applies tools or processes implementing improvements with a thorough 
					understanding of the product’s specifications. While code is being written, testers develop and implement the test plan for each feature 
					set included in the development cycle. All test sets are ready to perform at the end of coding in each cycle. At times, testing at the 
					“black box” level suffices to raise defects to the attention of testers and is relayed to the engineers writing code. During each cycle, 
					test plans can evolve – the advantage of the Agile method. Test planning becomes more sophisticated through the development process, 
					using the time available in each sprint to discover the most serious defects. Sometimes defects are deferred to meet time boxes and are 
					addressed in the next sprint. The focus is moving forward while meeting feature set requirements in the most efficient manner possible.<br><br>
					
					Before acceptance of a release, all customer requests and requirement changes are addressed. Testing isn’t complete before the product hits 
					customer hands. Often, the targeted market and system structure are unknown. No software is defect free, but taking into account the constraints 
					involved in using standard software development life cycles, Agile application of Agile methods are more suitable for dynamically changing 
					requirements with test planning an integral part of each step.<br><br>

					Test planning is the heart of the Agile Assurance Group’s quality assurance practices. Agile is headquartered in Hong Kong with its main 
					operations Center in Makati, the technology and financial hub of Manila, Philippines. Agile’s executive management consists of developers
