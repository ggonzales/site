					The Agile Assurance Group is uniquely positioned to provide the quality and cost efficiencies inherent in 
					outsourcing software development offshore to the Philippines. As small- and medium-sized entrepreneurial firms 
					search for economical means for software development, Agile stands ready to deliver while addressing the concerns 
					our clients have experienced in other Southeast Asian markets. Agile’s expatriate executive technology managers, 
					hailing from North America, Europe and Australia, leverage their decades of experience from working in in the 
					burgeoning information technology sectors throughout Southeast Asia, providing cost efficiencies unavailable to 
					businesses in Europe and North America.

				<div id="column1" class="grid_11">
					The cost overhead to maintain in-house a staff of quality developers, testers and Quality Assurance managers is 
					often prohibitive, and the number of graduates with technology degrees in Europe and the United States lags on a 
					per capita basis from those hailing from top-tier universities and technology firms in Manila.<br><br>

					The creativity, business good will, entrepreneurial focus and efficiencies of an American or European firm are 
					inhibited by the soaring costs associated with in-house software development. Offshore software development 
					outsourcing slashes development costs without dampening quality, allowing North American and European firms to 
					focus on core efficiencies. Maintaining highly qualified staff in-house, or ramping up engineers, programmers, 
					analysts, designers and testers for software development for individual projects, can be prohibitive and detract 
					from the firm’s core business.<br><br>
					
					Agile, headquartered in Hong Kong with its main operation center in Makati, the technology and financial hub of 
					Manila, Philippines, maintains an engineering staff that quickly assimilates a client’s unique business needs 
					and works hand-in-hand throughout the Software Development Life Cycle. In Manila, the information technology sector 
					has sprouted from the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, where the education and English language skills 
					of Filipinos have created the world’s largest call center hub, surpassing India and other emerging economies. 
					While English is the second language spoken by the majority of Filipinos, it is the official language for 
					education, business and education, negating any concerns of communication barriers Agile’s clients may have.<br><br>
					
					Independent Software Vendors have sprouted from this technology and cultural base, with universities and technical 
					institutes training a skilled workforce with a strong work ethic bolstered by a stable democratic government 
					bent on economic growth. Tax breaks for Regional Operating Headquarters administered by the Philippines Board 
					of Investors enable Agile to pass along additional business savings to overseas clients.<br><br>
					
					When offshore software development outsourcing first emerged on the radar of North American and European companies, 
					the initial benefit was the affordable salaries paid information technology workers in emerging economies. 
					Firms availed themselves of mid-level positions in the scheme of software development while maintaining expensive 
					project management in-house, a costly disadvantage at the time; but the talent in Southeast Asia’s technology 
					labor pool has matured, often led by expatriate executive developers, and provides top-quality developers, 
					programmers, testers and quality assurance staff who still work for emerging economy salaries.<br><br>
					
					Advantages to offshore software development outsourcing with Agile include lower labor costs, lower operating 
					costs, lower labor training costs and less production downtime.<br><br>
					
					Less expensive labor costs for skilled engineers and technicians was often eroded in many emerging economies 
					because of management overhead. Agile, on the other hand, well versed in local capabilities, culture, education 
					and the business environment, combined with their decades of experience in the technology sectors of the United 
					States, Ukraine and Australia, negate this potential pitfall.<br><br>
					
					The work culture evolving from the maturing call center or BPO sector in the Philippines eliminates the downtime 
					often associated with offshore software development outsourcing. Makati, the Central Business District of the 
					Philippines, hums 24 hours a day, with skilled labor working shifts to accommodate the time zones of clients in 
					North America and Europe. (Manila is GMT +8.)<br><br>
					
					Operating costs may be the largest advantage of offshore software development outsourcing. Agile’s clients 
					realize enormous savings in operational overhead, reducing expensive office space and computer network needs.<br><br>
					
					Disadvantages to offshore software development testing in other markets are huge, and include erosion of cost 
					advantage, culture, quality, low management maturity, skill availability, and staff turnover. Addressing these 
					potential risks has elevated Agile’s services to fill a badly needed niche.<br><br>
					
					In Makati, under the auspices of Agile’s expatriate executive management, tapping top-tier talent ensures the 
					highest quality of service, picking seasoned staff from the cream of the crop of Independent Software Vendors 
					throughout Southeast Asia and emerging talent from highly rated educational centers working under the supervision 
					of local managers with strong project and program management experience. In the Philippines, dedicated staff 
					committed not only to individual but organization success is culturally inherent, reducing turnover that can 
					contribute to project down time. Skilled labor costs for technology staff has remained constant, unlike in other 
					emerging economies.<br><br>
