					With today’s spiraling development costs and soaring employee overhead expenses, companies are turning to the 
					overseas firms such as the Agile Assurance Group, a quality offshore software development company, for their 
					technological solutions, whether to increase in-house business productivity with business-specific software or 
					for ground up product development for market release.<br><br>

					Agile, headquartered in Hong Kong with its main operations center in Makati, Philippines, is an Independent 
					Software Vendor providing all facets of software development and technology consultation. Agile practices are based 
					on experience and follow mature development practices, often dealing with clients who have had a negative 
					experience with another offshore software development company. Agile’s expatriate executive management has 
					decades of combined experience as an offshore, outsourcing technology solution provider; we know the pitfalls to 
					avoid and advantages of outsourcing software development offshore, carving out a niche delivering quality software 
					on deadline in an incremental, iterative process. Agile’s teams with companies across the globe who tap Agile’s 
					cost efficiencies; we guide firms in how to best utilize offshore development teams and avoid the high-cost of 
					in-house development. Agile’s clients turn to our skilled teams for desktop, systems or mobile application 
					development.<br><br>

					Why chose Agile as your firm’s offshore software development company? Our clients realize Agile’s teams reduce 
					risk, streamline communication, deliver incrementally, and handle not only development but post-deployment needs.<br><br>
					
					Who chooses Agile? For example, a West Coast firm in the United States may have absorbed the high cost of 
					ratcheting up staffing in-house for software development, only to layoff designers, programmers, testers and 
					business analysts after product deployment. While keeping post-production technical support staff on hand serves 
					the firm’s customers, it drags on the inherent creative competencies that the firm performs so well, creating 
					staffing costs better utilized to support workers in the firm’s core competencies. Many firms find hiring for 
					specific projects only to carry that overhead during non-development phases or to lay off workers after product 
					deployment bad for employee morale and the firm’s bottom line. Additionally, firms find that cranking up staffing 
					in non-core areas of the business not just inefficient, but unfair to investors and to the employees alike. 
					Another example is of a firm looking for software development solutions unique to their business plan.<br><br>
					
					The Agile Assurance Group is uniquely positioned to serve firms seeking technology solutions, undertaking all 
					facets of the Software Development Life Cycle, enabling our clients to turn their manpower and entrepreneurial 
					creativity to what they do best – devising creative technology solutions for the marketplace or to use in-house. 
					In hiring top talent from a pool of skilled engineers, programmers, designers, testers, quality assurance and 
					other technicians in the Philippines and throughout Southeast Asia, Agile’s executive management is quick to 
					analyze a client’s needs. Following the Agile development methodology, Agile’s teams work hand-in-hand in an 
					iterative process to create potentially shippable software components throughout the SDLC.<br><br>
					
					In Manila, the technology sector has matured, sprouting from the world’s largest Business Process Outsourcing 
					sector and call center hub, creating a trove of highly skilled, experienced programmers and engineers, but still 
					earning salaries typical of most emerging economies, resulting in costs savings to Agile’s clients without 
					sacrificing quality.<br><br>
					
					Agile is an offshore software development company that provides a full array of development services through an 
					iterative, incremental process:<br><br>
					<div id="indentedContent">
						<ul>			    
						    <li>At project launch, Agile’s client transition team uses its business experience and project management 
						    to define initial requirements. Agile follows an iterative process, dicing the project into well-defined 
						    periods of time with fixed goals and specific deliverables. Each iteration has transparency 
						    (delivery is on time and within budget), reliability (delivery is subject to acceptance procedures to 
						    confirm all requirements have been met), and reduced time-to-market (each delivery contains functionality
						     incrementally produced that can be used immediately until iteration completion).</li>
						    <li>To reduce concerns our clients have about using an offshore software development company, our 
						    experienced managers oversee all aspects of our independent teams, ensuring project communication with 
						    clients on a daily basis, thereby managing change, risk, Quality Assurance, and competency transfer 
						    throughout each intermediate delivery.</li>
						    <li>The Agile Software Development methodology followed by Agile pegs team independence and individual 
						    responsibility over tools and processes. While under the management of Agile’s expatriate executive 
						    developers, each team member has the freedom to be as creative as possible, and this approach is applied 
						    to Agile’s clients in consistent, competent communication throughout the iteration.</li>
