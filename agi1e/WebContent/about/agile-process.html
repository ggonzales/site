					Agile Software Development is an applied philosophy of iterative and incremental software development.
				</div>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div id="column1" class="grid_5">
					It adheres to a rigorous formula of holistic integration and on-the-spot product improvement as opposed to 
					documenting development at the conclusion of coding and sifting through the data for errors, compatibility and 
					functionality. The Agile software development process requires cross-functional teams taking ownership and 
					responsibility for their planning, deliverables, and timelines under the supervision of professional project 
					management. The Agile Software Development methodology is the foundation for nearly all activities undertaken 
					by the Agile Assurance Group.<br><br>
					<span style="color:#28ade1; font-size: 20px;">Agile isn’t just our name – it’s what we do.</span><br><br>
					Whether Agile is tasked with developing a client’s software or augmenting the client’s development team with our 
					quality control and assurance practices, you will see the “Agile philosophy” is our guiding principle.<br><br>
					The underlying principles of Agile Software Development are intuitive to most IT professionals, yet rarely applied 
					in a holistic fashion. The Manifest for Agile Software Development, published in 2001, is widely considered to be 
					the bible for efficient software development. <br><br>
					The principles of Agile Software Development’s manifesto are best summarized by Agile Assurance Group’s checklist:<br><br>
					<div id="indentedContent">
						<strong>Rapid Delivery</strong><br>
						projects broken into “milestones” and “sprints.” Sprints are incremental deadlines within a project’s overall 
						goals. Sprints typically last between one and three weeks and produce a potentially shippable incremental 
						product.<br><br>
						<strong>Constant interaction</strong><br>
						between Agile and our clients is a key distinction between Agile and other development methodologies. 
						Instead of relying solely on documentation to produce a product, the Agile philosophy requires that Project 
						Owner’s participation in daily Scrum sessions.<br><br>
						<strong>Change Requirements</strong><br>
						are accommodated even late in development. This is another key difference between Agile Software Development 
						and other methods and another reason close client interaction is required. The ability to accommodate change 
						is the essence of Agile.<br><br>
						<strong>Cooperation</strong><br>
						among various locations of project team members requires daily, consistent, efficient communication throughout 
						the development lifecycle.<br><br>
						<strong>Sustainable</strong><br>
						software development is a must. Even though development increments are called sprints, project planning must 
						allow for realistic goals within realistic deadlines.<br><br>
						<strong>Successful</strong><br>
						teams are comprised of talented, trusted staff motivated to practice technical excellence and superior 
						design.<br><br>
						<strong>Incrementally</strong><br>
						working software is the primary measure of our success.<br>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="column2" class="grid_5">
					The steps in Agile Assurance Group’s typical sprint process include:<br><br>
					<div id="indentedContent">
						<strong>Planning</strong><br>
						A technical team leader decides which features and requirements should be taken from a detailed schedule and 
						incorporated in the sprint. The decision on which features included in each sprint will be dictated by 
						architecture, dependencies, milestones and resource availability.<br><br>
						<strong>Defining Tracks</strong><br>
						This is an integral part of the planning process. A track is a succession of interdependent feature 
						requirements. Typically, developers focus on one track and do not move to another until reaching the sprint 
						or milestone. The number of tracks that can be identified limits waste of development resources.<br><br>
						<strong>Story Writing</strong><br>
						This is a critical part of the development and sprint process in a sophisticated, mature service delivery 
						model. This is where individual developers take ownership for their work and their estimates. A story is a 
						subset of requirements where a developer writes out the required functions from a user perspective, then 
						estimates the amount of time to complete the specific job. Stories also establish dependencies within the 
						feature and become an easy and reliable tool to estimate the effects of changes in user requirements.<br><br>
						<strong>Test Planning</strong><br>
						Quality assurance professionals determine where the key risks are in the sprint and the best way to test and 
						mitigate problems. QA Engineers typically assist Developers in story writing to ensure user functional requirements
						and design are accounted for.<br><br>
						<strong>Execution</strong><br>
						This is the phase of the sprint where development, QA, testing, and client interaction comes together. 
						By constant interaction among all stakeholders and daily meetings to assure requirements are being met, 
						the team remains on target to ship an incremental, working product. Burn down charts is used to track progress 
						versus goals on a daily basis.<br><br>
						<strong>Acceptance testing</strong><br>
						This is where the rubber meets the road. Quality control measures performed jointly by the Project owner and 
						our QA staff are performed on incrementally shippable product at the end of the sprint. The results of 
						acceptance testing determine the success of the sprint. Acceptance testing is done with an eye toward the 
						completeness of the incremental product compared to the requirements and designs.<br><br>
						<strong>Post-sprint meetings</strong><br>
						These face-to-face sessions of all team members are conducted at the conclusion of every sprint. These are 
						especially valuable in the case of failed sprints. Retrospective meetings are where the entire team learns 
						from their successes and failures and adjust performance for upcoming sprints. Retrospective meetings 
						determine what worked and what didn’t, which practices should be dropped and what lessons were learned.<br>
