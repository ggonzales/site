					Agile Assurance Group’s Software Quality Assurance uses systematic approaches in identifying, modifying, and 
					defining processes throughout the Software Development Life Cycle to provide clients an incrementally shippable 
					product and quality post-production support.
				</div>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div id="column1" class="grid_5">
					Quality Assurance involves assessment of previous versions of the project following a detailed development plan
					and allows for immediate implementation of changes throughout the Software Development Life Cycle. The ability
					to implement change during the SDLC is detailed in Scrum sessions. Our goal is to identify the highest risk
					potentials through rigorous testing plans established before coding begins following the methodology of Agile 
					Software Development.<br><br>
					<div id="quoteBox">
						The key to Quality Assurance is to provide Agile’s clients improved test strategies based on risk analysis, 
						cost optimization and reduced time-to-market. Agile devises stress and load testing, graphical user interface
						usability analysis, requirement conformance, security and penetration testing, among other QA services 
						detailed below.
					</div><br>
					Software testing is inherent in Quality Assurance, but our QA strategy establishes a solid testing plan at the 
					beginning of the product development lifecycle, creating realistic sprints overseen by our QA engineers and 
					developers. QA being long before a line of code is written and our clients have a seat at the table throughout QA 
					oversight.<br><br>
					Our QA engineers are skilled in working with our clients’ existing development teams. Agile’s approach reduces your 
					risk by preventing as many defects as possible from being shipped and by finding problems early in the SDLC. 
					Following the Agile Development philosophy, we integrate Software Quality Assurance Testing in all development 
					phases, including security testing, performance testing and post-market analysis.<br><br>
					Agile’s Software Quality Assurance Testing teams have found that working software as an end product is the optimal 
					goal as opposed to running through an entire development lifecycle and trying to back-engineer fixes through 
					extensive, exhaustive documentation. Our Software Quality Assurance Testing teams ensure Agile’s clients appreciate 
					that collaboration and interaction is an upfront and continual process occurring throughout the entire span of the 
					project. Agile’s Software Quality Assurance Testing favors incremental testing as opposed to testing at the end of 
					the coding phase, thereby creating an incrementally deliverable product.<br><br>
					Quality Assurance throughout the development lifecycle reduces risk, allowing for phased integration of changes and 
					fixes. This is the result of our commitment to continuous feedback between Agile’s QA staff and our clients. 
					Everyone is on the same page throughout each sprint and milestone. Agile’s Quality Assurance begins before code is 
					written; QA is part and parcel from the beginning of development. Agile’s clients have realized that test-driven 
					development creating incrementally deliverable software under the auspices of our Quality Assurance team results in
					quality software and satisfied customers.<br>
				</div>
				<div id="column2" class="grid_5">
					Agile’s Quality Assurance practices follow rigorous steps inherent in the Agile Software Development philosophy, including:
					<br><br>
					<div id="indentedContent">
						<strong>Test Planning.</strong><br/>
						The Quality Assurance team reviews specifications, architectural designs, and expected user experience to 
						develop test plans, steps and scenarios. Gaps are identified and addressed at this stage.<br>
						<strong>Testability.</strong><br/>
						Rigid traceability, the ability to show how requirements are derived from higher level requirements, allows for 
						testing of upward and downward requirements.<br>
						<strong>Integration testing.</strong><br>
						The Quality Assurance team must test to prove all areas of the system properly interface with no gaps in data flow.<br>
						<strong>Smoke testing.</strong><br>
						When development has reached a certain point per specifications, the Quality Assurance team creates tests to 
						verify development has reached build requirements. If build is not testable, Quality Assurance team leaders
						reject the build, or sprint. If portions of the build are testable, they are approved and documented.<br>
						<strong>Functional testing.</strong><br>
						Our QA team devises full functionality testing to assure each element of the application meets functional 
						requirements as outlined in all design documents.<br>
						<strong>Load and stress testing.</strong><br>
						This is where all non-functional testing proves the performance standards are met, including response time and 
						compatibility with specified browsers and operating systems and other variables.<br>
						<strong>Defect fixes validation.</strong><br>
						At this stage, the Quality Assurance team documents the solutions for known defects or issues realized during 
						development and validates those fixes through QA devised tests.<br>
						<strong>Regression testing.</strong><br>
						Quality Assurance team tests after each phase has been released to determine if any adverse effects will occur
						on previously released software.<br>
						<strong>Product release.</strong><br>
						The Quality Assurance team determines that the build is acceptable for production.<br>
						<strong>Post release.</strong><br>
						Agile’s QA services do not end at product deployment. Post release testing procedures are critical for total 
						user satisfaction.
					</div>
					<br>
					Agile's Software Quality Assurance Testing approach sets a detailed mechanism in problem reporting, corrective 
					action and tracking. QA determines proper steps for the tools, techniques and methodologies to handle all problems 
					in each development phase.
