					The Agile Assurance Group applies software quality metrics following industry best practices. 
					This is where Agile engineers apply a scientific approach using a schedule of measurements to analyze and 
					quantify software or the software’s specifications.
				</div>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				<div id="column1" class="grid_5">
					Creating a high-quality product by attacking defects and judging sustainability are achieved by evaluating 
					correctness, maintainability, integrity and usability – all critical to increasing product lifespan via 
					ultimate user satisfaction.<br><br>
					Applying software quality metrics is the gold standard in software development and guides all of our quality 
					assurance and management. <br><br>
					<div id="quoteBox">
						Software quality metrics are classed into three categories: product quality metrics, process quality metrics 
						and project quality metrics.
					</div>
					<br>
					Agile views the essence of applying software quality metrics is investigating the relationships among in-process 
					metrics, project characteristics and end-product quality. Based on Agile’s scientific evaluation, we engineer 
					improvements in both process and product, viewing quality from the entire software life cycle including measuring 
					the quality of maintenance and after support. The basics of software quality metrics are:<br><br>
					<div id="indentedContent">
						<strong>Product metrics.</strong><br>
						Agile first describes the characteristics of the product such as size, complexity, design features, 
						performance and quality. In product quality metrics, mean time to failure (MTTF), defect density, customer 
						problems and customer satisfaction are the parameters the software is sifted through. Defect density and MTTF 
						are the two main metrics for intrinsic product quality. At this stage of evaluation numerous attributes are 
						investigated, including data communication, distributed functions, performance, heavily used configurations, 
						transaction rate, online data entry, end-user efficiency, online update, complex processing, reusability, 
						installation ease, operational ease and rapid facilitation of change.<br><br>
						<strong>Process metrics.</strong><br>
						Here the focus is on how to improve software development and maintenance, from determining the effectiveness of 
						defect removal during development, judging the response time of the fix process and establishing the pattern of 
						testing. Phase-base defect removal patterns, defect removal effectiveness, defect density during formal machine 
						testing and defect arrival patterns during formal machine testing are all part of process metrics.<br><br>
						<strong>Project metrics.</strong><br>
						Getting a handle on the human and business aspect of the project requires an evaluation of all characteristics 
						and implementations including, the number of developers, quality assurance and testers on the team, all costs, 
						deadlines and scheduling and other mechanics throughout the software development life cycle.<br>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="column2" class="grid_5">
					Programs contain errors; the foundation of software evaluation is to identify risks, defects, failures and deliver 
					a product as free from dysfunction as possible. Software quality metrics are a series of complicated processes, but 
					the core elements – correctness, maintainability, integrity and sustainability – are generally applied across the 
					board.<br><br>
					<div id="indentedContent">
						<strong>Correctness</strong><br>
						Software has to work to be marketed and user satisfaction is the judge of the product’s lifespan – the proof 
						is correct function judged by performance. The most common measure is the number defects per thousand 
						(kilo or K) lines of code (LOC), referring to source code as opposed to machine code or assembly language. 
						KLOC is the widely used measure of a program’s size and offers a measure of defects compared to lines of code.<br><br>
						<strong>Maintainability</strong><br>
						All programs contain errors. Maintainability judges how quickly fixes can be implemented. Measuring 
						maintainability is elusive; it’s not a perfect qualitative or quantitative tangent. But an indirect means of 
						measuring maintainability is mean time to change (MTTC), or the time needed to implement a fix for defects. 
						MTTC estimates the average time from error detection to correcting function, or the time it takes to review 
						the change, design a modification, implement the fix and test the effectiveness of the repair.<br><br>
						<strong>Integrity</strong><br>
						Achieving software security is complex. Software quality metrics judge a program’s vulnerability to attack. 
						Integrity is measured by two parameters – threat (the probability of attack over product life span) and 
						security (the probability that a predictable attack can be countered over time.) Integrity is the sum of 
						threat multiplied by security.<br><br>
						<strong>Usability</strong><br>
						Working products sell; dysfunctional products die before marketing or fail in the marketplace. Agile’s 
						software quality metrics ensure the reduction in defects, maintainability, sustainability, integrity and 
						security, and ultimate success is judged by user satisfaction. Usability is determined by the physical or 
						intellectual skills users need to learn the system, the time it takes a user to be moderately efficient in 
						operating the system and the level of increased productivity created by the product. Agile’s experienced staff 
						devises precise user reviews and questionnaires to glean the ultimate determination of your product’s success
						 – user satisfaction is always based on program functionality.<br>
					</div>
					<br>
					Applying software quality metrics is the overall paradigm guiding Agile’s quality assurance services, whether 
					evaluating your product or developing our own for you – the key is the delivery of the highest quality software 
					possible.<br>
